# User Prompt
Please update this python project so that it includes an MCP server integration.
The `oracle_server` directory is where the main python logic will be.

Add an example script `test_mcp_server.py` for validation.

If new packages are needed, add them to the `pyproject.toml`.

All configurations like in `oracle_server/config/config.py`. For now,
have all new configuration variables be `Optional`.
